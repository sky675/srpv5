<p>In the Zone's culture, being a stalker is more of a career than a title as traders like Sidorovich and Barkeep are not considered stalkers by other zone dwellers, even though they are illegally residing inside the zone. Bandits are borderline cases as they are not called "stalkers" by other stalkers, though the authorities label them as such, and they use the word for themselves. The stalker's primary act of "stalking" or "looting", as the military characterizes it, is the smuggling of radioactive and unidentified objects from the zone that is highly dangerous for human health and life. And stalkers seem to have adopted this concept, since exploiting and robbing others do not fall within their usual agendas.
    Officially, stalkers are trespassing in a restricted ecological disaster zone and will be shot on sight by the military due to armed encounters in the past. Unofficially, they are the most reliable workhorses for any individual who wants something retrieved in the Zone as they are the most experienced people who can be enlisted. Indeed, without stalkers, curiosities like artifacts would be a rarity outside the Zone and the experiments of the Ecologists would be stalled for a considerable amount of time as the military is hardly able to assist them because of their slipping control, low morale, and lack of sufficient manpower.             
    Stalkers come to the Zone for a number of reasons. Some go for profit, some for adventure, some seek to get away from the world, to escape the law or personal problems. It follows that former criminals can be found in all of the stalker factions except Duty, though most criminals not part of a bandit clan have long since started new lives.

    <h3 class="post-title">Military Test</h3>
    <p>The Ukrainian military supposedly has the Zone contained in order to prevent the looting of dangerous, radioactive materials and to prevent the unauthorized entering of any individuals. They allegedly enforce this rule with a "Shoot-on-sight" declaration. In an ironic twist, because of major corruption within their ranks, they themselves are the reason why Stalkers can continue to operate, and why radioactive materials from the Zone keep flowing to the outside world. Overtly, the Military are hostile to all Stalkers, to keep up appearances; but they also make shady dealings with them at the same time.</p></div>

<div class="post-content">
    <h3 class="post-title">Bandits</h3>
    <p>The Bandits are raiders and marauders of the Zone, ranging from petty thugs and gangsters to organized crime syndicates. Apart from Freedom, which treats them with marginal contempt, everyone hates the Bandits due to their nefarious acts of robbing and exploiting honest Stalkers. Most Bandits are unorganized and leaderless; there are only a few known Bandit leaders and camps, and even then their groups are still fairly disorganized, with underlings always trying to take control by overthrowing the previous leader. Their unit size is mediocre, and their equipment is cheap and shoddy; because of this they've adapted to a guerilla style of warfare, ambushing small groups with large numbers by camping in locations just off the normal paths.</p></div>

<div class="post-content">
    <h3 class="post-title">Duty</h3>
    <p>Duty was founded by former military expedition survivors and Stalkers concerned about the looming horrors of the Zone. They are one of the largest Stalker clans in the Zone. They have a strict military code (such as no smoking, maintaining one's weapons, etc...) and operate in a military fashion, using ranks like Sergeant, Major, Captain, and General. Their goal is to contain and destroy the Zone, fearing that it will spread to the outside world. They view the Zone as an ulcer in the world and their efforts are a way to excise it. They do this with blunt force by killing mutants, eliminating all who oppose them or exploit the free, and burning down or drowning mutant dens. They are neutral toward other Zone factions, save for the Bandits and their long-time nemesis: the Freedom faction. It is said that Duty also has deep connections within the military, specifically Spetsnaz detachments within the Zone, although they treat regular grunts with utter contempt.</p></div>

<div class="post-thumb-right"><img src="asset://garrysmod/materials/sky/faction_icons/freedom.png" /></div>
<div class="post-content">
    <h3 class="post-title">Freedom</h3>
    <p>Freedom is a clan of stalkers who fight for free access to the Zone, and their views are somewhat anarchistic, believing nobody can own the Zone and seeing it both as a scientific marvel and as a free life inside the Zone's borders. In contrast to the regimented, highly disciplined atmosphere of Duty, the members of Freedom have a much more relaxed, informal attitude. They appear to have a more casual command structure, often referring to each other as "bro", with a number of members shown making regular recreational use of alcohol and marijuana. This further reflects their status as a clan of like-minded free spirits, unlike the ex-military soldiers of Duty.</p></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">Stalkers</h3>
    <p>Loners are a nomadic semi-unified group of Stalkers who simply live off the Zone in order to earn some coin for their daily lives. Loners are neutral toward almost all other factions, but do have complications with the Military, and, to a lesser extent, the Mercenaries, and openly oppose the Bandit faction for their actions against free Stalkers. Most Loners are only concerned with the riches of the Zone, and do not pay attention to the other factions' hatred for each other - provided, of course, they do not threaten them. Because of this, Loners are often recruited by various factions as mercenaries.</p></div>

<div class="post-content">
    <h3 class="post-title">Mercenaries</h3>
    <p>The Mercenaries are a private military force operating within the Zone. They are professional soldiers who will do just about anything in the Zone, ranging from retrieval, assassinations, body-guarding, etc. Though, of course, it must be for the right price. Mercenaries are usually neutral toward other factions, as they are a source of income, unless they interfere with their operations.</p></div>

<div class="post-content">
    <h3 class="post-title">Ecologists</h3>
    <p>The Ecologists are Ukrainian scientists sent into the Zone on behalf of the government, but seem to be affiliated with outside organizations. Their main purpose is the study of all aspects of the Zone, using scientific methods to further explain what the Zone is, and its purpose. The Ecologists are neutral to all factions, and are not involved in any of their conflicts. Due to the military's slipping grip on the Zone, the Ecologists rely on opportunistic Dutyers, Loners, and Mercenaries to provide them protection, and to perform errands that may require combat, since the scientists are better thinkers than fighters.</p></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">Monolith</h3>
    <p>The Monolith were originally ordinary Stalkers who believed in the power of the Wish Granter. Prior to Clear Sky, the faction reportedly made an exodus to the Zone's center and disappeared. After the large emission during the events of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, they became active. The Monolith are the front line soldiers of the C-Consciousness, and would rather die than let any Stalker reach the sacred crystal. Although capable of higher reasoning and emotion, they nevertheless carry out orders with fanatic effectiveness. The Monolith faction has no allies, and actively attacks all other factions.</p></div>
