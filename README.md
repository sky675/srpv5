# sky's Stalker Roleplay

**This will likely not be modified past this point
I won't bother to add a license or anything, you can do what you want with any piece of material or code associated with this, my only request is that you keep the author fields in the schema and various plugins intact, only adding onto it.**

A custom NutScript-based schema for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. roleplay (based on the game series not the crime). Includes lots of gameplay features to both boost rp as well as fill the void between.

Includes a multitude of custom plugins as well as a modified version of NutScript.

## Installation

Drop the `nutscript` and `stalker` folders into your `garrysmod/gamemodes/` folder and set your gamemode launch option as such:

```
-gamemode stalker
```

The gamemode by default is set up for the addons from this collection: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2489641694, you'll need to modify `sh_config.lua` in the schema to add/remove the workshop addons used.

## Feature list

- PDA system (messaging, leaderboard)
- Stalker Themed UI
- Custom Player Model System
- Gear Ratings & Protections
- Crafting
- Trait Tree System
- Languages
- Weapon and Armor durability
- more

## Also included

- A modified version of [evolve](https://github.com/Xandaros/evolve) (namely adding @ as admin chat)
- Various VJ Base human NPCs, using the same model system as players do. Note that they do not function properly outside of the schema.
- An assortment of various other NPCs and entities from various sources.
- Assorted small autorun scripts taken and modified from various sources.

- the many many authors of various scripts and assets that we've used throughout the lifetime of this schema, from srpv1 back in 2017, to the most recent and likely last iteration in 2021.

### sky's shameless plug:
if you ever joined this or any previous iteration of this schema (or end up using anything from this for that matter too!), and want to support the work i've done throughout the years on this, you can help me out by buying [my game](https://sky675.itch.io/oasis). it'd be extremely appreciated!
